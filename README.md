🐠 Personal ASP.NET Core Monolith Project Structure

## Goal
✅ Define a ready to use monolith template\
✅ ASP.NET Core (try to update to latest stable version)\
🚧 Ready to use with domain events, exception handling, caching, logging

## Why ?
Tired of different layers for Service, Repository, Unit of Work blablabla

## What ?
Looks like Vertical slice ? Yes it is, but not strictly 100% follow vertical slice (as this share presentation layer)
