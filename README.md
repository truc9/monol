🐠 Personal ASP.NET Core Monolith Project Structure

## Goal
✅ Define a ready to use monolith template\
✅ ASP.NET Core (try to update to latest stable version)\
🚧 Ready to use with domain events, exception handling, caching, logging

## Why ?
Fed up with managing separate layers for services, repositories, and units of work. Often, the database provider remains constant, but customer requirements tend to evolve.

## What ?
While this structure adopts a vertical slice approach, it doesn't strictly adhere to it, as it includes a shared presentation layer.
